# 🚦 Road Hazard Analytics 🚦

This project is part of the Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI), organized by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, Egypt. The goal is to analyze traffic incidents across the United States to identify patterns and factors contributing to road accidents. The insights gained will help in developing targeted safety measures, improving road designs, and creating data-driven policies to enhance overall road safety.

## 📊 Project Overview

The project aims to classify and analyze road incidents documented between January 2018 and December 2019, covering approximately 1.16 million traffic incidents across 49 states in the USA. Data sources include multiple APIs providing real-time information from federal and state transportation departments, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and road sensors.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

The project uses a variety of tools and technologies for data analysis, storage, and visualization:

- **Python (NumPy and Pandas)**: For data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.
- **PostgreSQL**: For data storage, management, and querying.
- **SQL Server Management Studio**: For SQL-based data manipulation and querying.
- **Power BI**: For interactive data visualization, enabling stakeholders to explore traffic incident trends.

## 📁 Dataset Information

The dataset consists of approximately 1.16 million records with the following columns:

- **Amenity**
- **Bump**
- **City**
- **County**
- **Crossing**
- **Day**
- **Day_Name**
- **Description**
- **Give_Way**
- **Hour**
- **Humidity**
- **Junction**
- **Minutes**
- **Month**
- **No_Exit**
- **Pressure_in**
- **Railway**
- **Roundabout**
- **Season**
- **Severity**
- **State**
- **Station**
- **Stop**
- **Street**
- **Temperature_C**
- **Timezone**
- **Traffic_Calming**
- **Traffic_Signal**
- **Turning_Loop**
- **Visibility_mi**
- **Weather_Condition**
- **Wind_Direction**
- **Wind_Speed_mph**
- **Year**
- **Zone**

Data is sourced from multiple channels such as government transportation agencies, law enforcement, and road sensors to provide a comprehensive view of road incidents.

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Incident Trends**: Analysis of incident trends over time, revealing an increase in incidents from September to October, followed by a decline in November.
- **Weather Impact**: Exploration of the relationship between weather conditions and incident severity.
- **High-Risk Locations**: Identification of locations with a high number of severe incidents for targeted safety interventions.
- **Day vs. Night Analysis**: Comparison of incidents occurring during the day versus nighttime.

## 📝 Recommendations

Based on the data analysis, the following recommendations were made:
1. Implement targeted safety measures during peak months of road incidents, such as September and October.
2. Focus on improving road conditions in areas with a high frequency of severe incidents.
3. Increase safety awareness campaigns during adverse weather conditions.
4. Enhance road designs and implement traffic-calming measures in high-risk zones.
5. Evaluate current safety interventions regularly to ensure they are effective in reducing road accidents.
